CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.8.7

    NEW FEATURES

	- The configure script now uses the local PNG, ZLIB,
	  and/or JPEG libraries when they are new enough.
	- The configure script now uses the -fno-rtti,
	  -fno-exceptions, -fomit-frame-pointer, and -fpermissive
	  options as needed with GCC (smaller, faster executables,
	  works around X header bugs in Solaris.)
	- Added a --toctitle option to set the table-of-contents
	  title from the command-line (was only available in the
	  GUI in previous releases...)
	- New "NEED amount" comment to force a page feed if there
	  is not sufficient room on the page for the following
	  text.

    CHANGES

	- Increased default MAX_PAGES to 10000 (was 5000.)
	- File links in book files now point to the top of the
	  next page.
	- <TABLE ALIGN=xyz> now aligns the table (previously it
	  just set the default alignment of cells.)
	- Transparent GIFs now use the body color instead of white
	  for the transparent color.
	- Updated to LIBPNG 1.0.6 in source distribution.
	- Updated the default cellpadding to be 1 pixel to match
	  Netscape output.
	- Updated line and block spacing to match Netscape.

    BUG FIXES

	- Now ignore illegal HTML in tables.
	- The VALIGN code didn't handle empty cells properly.
	- Wasn't offsetting the start of each row by the cell
	  padding.
	- The JPEG image loading code didn't work for some JPEG
	  images, particularly those from digital cameras (JPEG
	  but not JFIF format.)
	- The strikethrough line was not being drawn in the
	  correct position.
	- Wasn't setting the height of BR elements, so <BR><BR>
	  didn't insert a blank line.
	- The table of contents would show the wrong page numbers
	  if no title page was generated.
	- Cell widths did not subtract any border, padding, or
	  spacing from the "preferred" width, causing formatting
	  differences between web browsers and HTMLDOC.
	- The PNG loading code did not handle interlacing or
	  transparency.
	- The HTML parsing code did not prevent elements in
	  embedded files from completing elements in the parent
	  file.
	- The table CELLSPACING amount was being applied twice in
	  the table sizing calculations.


CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.8.6

    NEW FEATURES

	- New linkcolor and linkstyle options.

    CHANGES

	- Minor source changes for OS/2 compilation.
	- SUP and SUB now raise/lower text more to be consistent with
	  browser look-n-feel.
	- Non-breaking space by itself was being output.  Now check for
	  that and ignore strings that consist entirely of whitespace.
	- New progress bar.

    BUG FIXES

	- Didn't add whitespace after a table caption.
	- Nested tables caused formatting problems (flatten_tree()
	  didn't insert breaks for new rows)
	- A cell whose minimum width exceeded the available width
	  for the table would cause the table to go off the page.
	- Cells that spanned more than two pages were drawn with boxes
	  around them rather than just the sides.
	- The stylesheet info in the HTML output specified the H1 size
	  for all headings.
	- The title page was incorrectly formatted when an image was
	  specified - the text start position was computed using the
	  pixel height of the title image and not the formatted height.
	- 1 color images didn't come out right; the "fix" to work around
	  an Acrobat Reader bug was being done too soon, so the color
	  lookups were wrong.
	- HTML file links now work properly.
	- Now limit all HTML input to the maximum size of input buffers
	  to avoid potential buffer overflow problems in CGIs.
	- If a row had a predefined height, HTMLDOC wasn't making sure
	  that the row would fit on the current page.
	- THEAD, TFOOT, and TBODY caused problems when formatting tables.
	  Note: THEAD and TFOOT are *still* not supported, however the
	  code now properly ignores them and parses the rows in the
	  TBODY group.
	- The VALIGN code introduced in the 1.8.5 release didn't check
	  for NULL pointers in all cases.


CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.8.5

    NEW FEATURES

	- New "--titlefile" option to include an HTML file for
	  the title page(s).
	- New 'C' header/footer option to show current page
	  number within chapter or HTML file.
	- Allow adding of .book files to import all HTML files
	  in the book.
	- New "HALF PAGE" page comment to feed 1/2 page.
	- Added VALIGN and HEIGHT support in tables.

    CHANGES

	- Now optimize link objects in PDF files (provides a 40k
	  reduction in file size for the HTMLDOC manual alone)
	- Table rows that cross page boundaries are now rendered
	  more like Netscape and MSIE.
	- Now support HTMLDOC_DATA and HTMLDOC_HELP environment
	  variables under UNIX (for alternate install directory)
	- Now show error messages when HTMLDOC can't open the
	  AFM, character set, or PostScript glyph files.
	- The logo image is now scaled to its "natural" size (as
	  it would appear in a web browser)
	- Now recognize VALIGN="MIDDLE" or VALIGN="CENTER".

    BUG FIXES

	- Generation of PDF files to the standard output (i.e.
	  to the web server + browser) didn't work on some
	  versions of UNIX.  HTMLDOC now writes the PDF output
	  to a temporary file and then copies it to the standard
	  output as needed.
	- PDF links were missing the first 5 characters in the
	  filename; the code was trying to skip over the "file:"
	  prefix, but that prefix was already skipped elsewhere.
	- Nested descriptive lists (DL) did not get rendered
	  properly.
	- Tables had extra whitespace before and after them.
	- Multiple aligned images confused parse_paragraph();
	  the images would overlap instead of stack on the
	  sides.


CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.8.4

    CHANGES

	- More configure script changes for FLTK DSOs.
	- FileIcon.cxx was still using NULL for outline (an
	  integer), which caused some ANSI C++ compilers to
	  complain.

    BUG FIXES

	- The Fonts and Colors tab groups did not extend to
	  the full width of the tab area, which prevented the
	  Browse button from working when clicked on the right
	  side.
	- The help dialog window did not scroll all the way to
	  the bottom of the text.
	- The chapter ("c") header/footer string did not work.
	- The heading ("h") header/footer string did not always
	  match the first heading on a page.
	- The header and footer fonts were not used when
	  computing the widths of the header and footer strings.
	- The Windows distribution did not create the right
	  shortcut for the Users Manual in the Start menu.
	- The command-line code did not accept "--grayscale",
	  only "--gray"
	- Multi-file HTML output did not use the right link for
	  the table-of-contents file if no title page was being
	  generated.
	- Extra whitespace before and after tables has been
	  eliminated.


CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.8.3

    NEW FEATURES

	- New "--browserwidth" option to control scaling of images and
	  tables that use fixed pixel widths.

    CHANGES

	- The configure script now looks for the OpenGL library
	  (required if you use a shared FLTK library with OpenGL
	  support.)
	- Increased the max number of chapters to 1000.

    BUG FIXES

	- Page break comments didn't force a paragraph break.
	- --no-toc prevented chapters from being output in PS
	  and PDF files.
	- Filenames didn't always get updated properly when doing a
	  "save as"...
	- Fixed some more leading/trailing whitespace problems.
	- Wasn't freeing page headings after the document was
	  generated.
	- Wasn't range checking the current chapter number; now
	  limits the number of chapters to MAX_CHAPTERS and
	  issues an error message whenever the limit is exceeded.


CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.8.2

    NEW FEATURES

	- New "setup" program for UNIX software installation.

    CHANGES

	- Documentation updated for new UNIX "setup" program and
	  "..." usage for headers and footers.
	- Changed margins to floating point (instead of integer) to
	  improve table column accuracy.

    BUG FIXES

	- HTMLDOC could crash under Microsoft Windows with some
	  types of HTML files.  This was caused by a stack overflow,
	  usually when processing nested tables.
	- Multiple HTML files weren't being converted properly in
	  web page mode - only the last file would be generated for
	  PostScript output, and no file for PDF output.
	- Wasn't preserving the whitespace between "one" and "two"
	  in the HTML code "one<I> two</I> three".
	- Paragraph spacing was inconsistent.
	- <TABLE WIDTH="xx"> wasn't formatted properly.
	- The command-line code wasn't opening HTML files in binary
	  mode. This caused problems under Microsoft Windows.


CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.8.1

    CHANGES

	- The configure script didn't update the ARFLAGS
	  variable for *BSD operating systems (no "s" option to
	  build the symbol table...)
	- Changed the installation commands to only create the
	  installation directory if it does not exist.  This
	  prevents installation errors on some platforms the
	  second time around.
	- Now use the Microsoft definitions for characters 128
	  through 159 that are otherwise unused by the
	  ISO-8859-x character sets.
	- Now set optimization settings when we know the compiler.	
	- Now always quote attribute values in HTML output to make
	  HTML lint programs happy.

    BUG FIXES

	- Wasn't using TOC title string in PDF document outline.
	- Preformatted text in tables didn't force the column
	  width.
	- Cells using COLSPAN > 1 didn't contribute to the width
	  of columns.
	- The table code didn't enforce the per-column minimums
	  under certain circumstances, causing "scrambled"
	  columns.
	- The configure script and makefiles didn't work when
	  FLTK was not available.  They now only build the "gui"
	  library when it is available.
	- The Windows distribution was installing files under
	  PROGRAMDIR instead of TARGETDIR.  This prevented users
	  from customizing the installation directory.
	- The configure script overrode the LDFLAGS environment
	  variable, preventing FLTK from being located in a non-
	  default directory.


CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.8

    NEW FEATURES

	- Now support PDF 1.1 (Acrobat 2.x) and PDF 1.3 (Acrobat 4.0).
	- Now support PDF page modes, layouts, and effects, and the
	  first page that is displayed in Acrobat Reader.
	- Now support PostScript Level 3 output with Flate image
	  compression.
	- Now support PostScript commands for page size and duplexing.
	- Now add filenames as needed to HTML links.
	- Added optimizations to output code to further reduce PDF and
	  PostScript file size.
	- Now support alternate 8-bit character sets. Currently we
	  supply data files for the ISO-8859-N character sets.
	- Added chapter headings to the available header/footer
	  formats.
	- The GUI file chooser is significantly improved and supports
	  selection of multiple HTML files.
	- The GUI now provides on-line help.
	- Many other GUI improvements.
	- Added support for DIR and MENU block elements.
	- The header and footer text can now be made boldface, italic,
	  etc.
	- Font settings are now exported to HTML files in a style
	  sheet.
	- Now support page breaks using HTML comments.
	- The image dimensions are now exported to HTML files.
	- Added landscape printing option.
	- Added CAPTION support for tables.
	- Filename links now work for HTML files included in a
	  document.
	- Now support BGCOLOR in tables.

    CHANGES

	- Lots of documentation changes.
	- Much better table formatting.
	- Changed HTML output to use less invasive navigation bars at
	  the top and bottom of each file.  This also means that the
	  "--barcolor" option is no longer supported!
	- Updated to use existing filenames in HTML (directory) output.
	- Now recognize any local PDF file as a local file link (i.e.
	  you just need "HREF=filename.pdf" and not
	  "HREF=file:filename.pdf")
	- <TT>, <CODE>, and <SAMP> no longer reduce the font size.
	- Now put whitespace after image data in PDF files.  This
	  change was needed to work around a bug in Acrobat Reader 4.0.
	- Now generate a complete encoding vector for fonts in PDF
	  files.  This change was needed to work around a bug in all
	  versions of Acrobat Exchange that did not recognize the
	  WinANSI encoding defined in the PDF specifications.
	- Now filter out the BREAK attribute from HR elements.
	- Now only load images once.

    BUG FIXES

	- Wasn't escaping &,<, or > in HTML output
	- Wasn't preserving &nbsp;
	- Links in multi-file HTML output were off-by-one.
	- BLOCKQUOTE needed to be like CENTER and DIV.
	- Needed to use existing link name if present for headings to
	  avoid nested link name bug in Netscape and MSIE.
	- Extremely long link names could cause TOC generation to fail
	  and HTMLDOC to crash.
	- PDF output was not compatible with Ghostscript/Ghostview
	  because Ghostscript does not support inherited page resources
	  or the "Fl" abbreviation for the "FlateDecode" compression
	  filter.
	- PostScript DSC comments didn't have unique page numbers. This
	  caused Ghostview (among others) to get confused.
	- Some functions didn't handle empty text fragments.
	- Images couldn't be scaled both horizontally and vertically.
	- <LI> didn't support the VALUE attribute (but <OL> did...)
	- Fixed whitespace problems before and after some markups that
	  was caused by intervening links.
	- The indexed image output code could generate an image with only
	  1 color index used, which upset Acrobat Reader.
	- Fixed a bug in table-of-contents handling - HTMLDOC would crash
	  on some systems if you converted a web page on the command-line.
	- Wasn't setting the font size and spacing soon enough when
	  generating files on the command-line.
	- Didn't hide EMBED elements when generating indexed HTML files.
	- Didn't always set the current drawing position before drawing
	  a box or line.
	- Base85 encoding of image data was broken for PostScript output.
	- JPEG compression was broken for PostScript output.
	- Didn't set binary mode for the standard output under Windows
	  and OS/2 needed.


CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.7

	- Added option for overriding the background color or image.
        - Added default font typeface and size options.
	- Added progress indicator for page formatting.
	- The HTMLDOC window is now resizeable.
	- The <TABLE> and <CENTER> markups didn't start a new block.
	- strcasecmp and friends are not available on all platforms.
	- Added support for MacOS (command-line only).
	- The width of table cells could be off by 1 point causing
	  unnecessary text wrapping.
	- The GUI's default center footer wasn't "blank".
	- Images could be "lost" if they reside in the current
	  directory or use an absolute path.
        - Documents without titles or headings could crash HTMLDOC.
	- The image loading code could crash due to a MSVC++ runtime
          library bug.
        - Spacing before <HR>'s wasn't consistent.
	- Buffer overflow problems causing crashes.
	- Didn't accept whitespace in variables, e.g. "<TAG NAME = VALUE>"
	- Links didn't always get propagated.
	- The Flate compressor data was not getting freed, so HTMLDOC
	  could use a lot of memory when compression was enabled.


CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.6

	- Now support JPEG compression of images.
	- Now have selectable Flate (ZIP) compression level.
	- Now only adjust top and bottom margins if headers and
	  footers are used.
	- Better HTML output support (now remember files for
	  links in multi-file output).
	- Increased maximum page count to 5000.
	- Needed to show headers on all pages in web page mode.
	- Now recognize both "in" and "inch" for measurements.
	- <BR> was not handled properly.
	- Selecting "web page" in the GUI clears the title toggle.
	- TABLE row spacing was not right...
	- <TD COLSPAN=n> now draws multi-column borders.
	- Column widths were computed wrong when COLSPAN was used.
	- Nested lists were not handled right.
	- Internal links didn't work for PDF output.
	- Block spacing should now be more consistent.
	- Image scaling was off - now only use page width so that
	  images are not warped.
        - The footer was always one line too low.
	- Couldn't double-click on input filename to edit.


CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.5

	- Added customization of headers and footers.
	- Added new "--title" image option.
	- Can now put logo image in header or footer.
	- <MARKUP ID="name"> now works for link destinations.
	- The table of contents now appears as part of the document
	  outline in PDF output.
	- Links to local PDF files are now treated as file links in PDF
	  output instead of web links.
	- You can now turn the title page on/off as desired.
	- PostScript and PDF output to stdout now works.
	- Nested tables now format properly.
	- <HR> now provides horizontal rule; to get a page break use
	  "<HR BREAK>".
        - Fixed <TABLE BORDER=0> bug.
	- Fixed GIF loader bug (caused problems on Alpha machines)
	- No longer get extra line after list items.
	- <FONT> markup nesting now works.
	- "&" by itself would cause loss of 15 characters.
	- The current directory was not tracked properly under Windows.
	- The right, top, and bottom margins were not being saved properly.
	- The htmlReadFile() function could consume too much stack space,
	  causing a program failure.
	- PostScript and PDF files were corrupt when generating a web
	  page with a title page.


CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.4

	- Now use autoconf "configure" script to build UNIX makefile.
        - Now handle relative filenames a lot better when loading images
	  and files.
	- Added "--webpage" option to support printing of plain HTML
	  files (i.e. not documents with chapters)
	- Added support for document backgrounds in PostScript and PDF
	  output
	- Added "--no-toc" and "--no-title" options to disable the
	  table-of-contents and title pages, respectively
	- PDF files now store all named links for use from a web page
	  (HREF="filename.pdf#name")
        - Converted to C++
	- Now using FLTK for the GUI under UNIX and Windows (yeah, one
	  set of code!)
	- Merged GUI and command-line versions
	- Greatly enhanced GUI now supports nearly all command-line
	  options.
	- Miscellaneous fixes to HTML parsing code
	- PDF links should now go to the right page all the time
	- Fixed DSC comments in PostScript output to conform to the

	- Fixed dumb bug in Windows version - didn't handle HTML files
	  with only a LF at the end of each line (this is a BUG in the
	  MSVC++ runtime libraries!)
	- <PRE> inside a list didn't work
	- parse_table() and friends didn't check for a NULL parent
	  pointer.
	- Paragraph text that wasn't enclosed by P markups was
	  located on the wrong page when followed by a H1 markup.

CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.3.1

	- Fixed font encoding vector in PostScript output (minus instead
	  of hyphen for '-' character).


CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.3

        - New GUI for managing documents (Windows + X11/Motif)
	- Better table printing with support for user-specified column
	  widths and better automatic-sizing
        - PNG loading now works when grayscale output is requested
	- No image optimization was performed in PDF or Level 2 PostScript
	  files.  HTMLDOC now converts images to indexed (1,2,4,8 bits) if
	  there is an advantage (fewer bits per pixel) and no loss of color
	  would occur
	- The filenames in links were getting lost when writing indexed
	  HTML to a directory
	- The logo image filename wasn't being localized when writing
	  indexed HTML to a directory
	- Fonts, images, and links weren't supported inside a PRE tag
	- Added support for the <!DOCTYPE> markup
	- No longer assume that chars are unsigned by default
	- Invalid or missing links no longer generate bad PDF files
	- External links (http:, ftp:, etc) now work
	- Escaped characters are now decoded correctly in the table of
	  contents in PDF files
	- Image scaling is now more intelligent


CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.2

        - Now support "internal" links in a document (PDF & HTML).
        - Added "no compression" option for PDF files; this is needed for
          older PDF readers like Acroread 2.x.
        - Much better parsing of HTML; should now work very well with the
          HTML output by Netscape Composer.
        - Wasn't opening image files in "binary" mode (Windows).
        - The htmlReadString() and htmlWriteString() functions were removed
          because of portability problems to HP-UX and Windows, among others.


CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.1

        - Ordered (numbered) lists are now supported, as are the TYPE=, START=,
          and VALUE= option variables.
        - Now support coverpages for PS and PDF output with optional logo image.
        - Running headings (at the bottom of PS/PDF pages) are now tracked
          correctly.
        - Fixed parsing of lists so lists generated by Netscape Composer work
          right...
        - Fixed HTML links when generating a single HTML file.
        - The --numbered option didn't number all headings (only those in the
          table-of-contents).


CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.0

        - Initial version.
