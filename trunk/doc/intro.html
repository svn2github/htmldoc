<H1 ALIGN="RIGHT">Introduction</H1>

This document describes how to use the <I>HTMLDOC</I> software, version
1.8. <I>HTMLDOC</I> is a Hyper-Text Markup Language ("HTML") document processing
program that generates indexed HTML, Adobe&reg; PostScript&reg;, and Adobe Portable Document
Format ("PDF") files suitable for printing or online viewing.

<P>No restrictions are placed upon the output produced by <I>HTMLDOC</I>.

<H2>History</H2>

Like many programs <I>HTMLDOC</I> was developed in response to a need
our company had for generating high-quality documentation in printed and
electronic forms. For a while we used FrameMaker&reg; and a package
from <CODE>sgi</CODE> that generated "compiled" Standard Generalized
Markup Language ("SGML") files that could
be used by the Electronic Book Technologies ("EBT") documentation products (EBT
is now owned by <A HREF="http://www.inso.com">INSO</A>.) When <CODE>sgi</CODE>
stopped supporting these tools we were stuck. INSO laughed in our faces
when we said we could afford up to $10,000 US for an updated book
generation product that would work with the IRIX&reg;, Solaris&reg;, and HP-UX
documentation systems. Other solutions were nearly as expensive, or
simply not capable of doing the things we needed.

<P>Because of these things we decided to write our own program to generate
our documentation. HTML seemed to be the source format of choice since
WYSIWYG HTML editors are widely (and freely) available and at worst you
can use a plain text editor. We needed HTML output for documentation on
our web server, PDF for customers to read and/or print from their computers,
and PostScript for our own printing needs.

<P>The result of our efforts is the <I>HTMLDOC</I> software which is now
available for UNIX&reg; and Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg;. Among other
things, this software users manual was produced using <I>HTMLDOC</I>.

<H2>Why Just HTML?</H2>

Some people have asked why this program only deals with HTML input files
and is not able to read any SGML or Extensible Markup Language ("XML") file.
The reasons are numerous but basically boil down to:

<OL>

	<LI>SGML and XML are moving targets since all documents use Document Type Definition
	("DTD") files to define what markups are actually supported, and special scripting
	mechanisms to support arbitrary page markings. Formatting and
	processing can become a nightmare if the DTD or scripting files contain even a single
	typographic error.

	<LI>Tools for SGML and XML file generation cost considerably more than software that
	generates HTML files. Also, the number of HTML tools is at least an order
	of magnitude greater than the number of SGML and XML tools!
