</DIV>
<H2><A NAME=1_1>About This Software</A></H2>
 This document describes how to use the <I>HTMLDOC</I> software, 
version 1.8. <I>HTMLDOC</I> is a HTML document processing program that 
generates indexed HTML, Adobe&reg; PostScript<SUP>TM</SUP>, and Adobe 
Portable Document Format (PDF 1.2) files suitable for printing or 
online viewing. 
<P>No restrictions are placed upon the output produced by <I>HTMLDOC</I>
. </P>
<H2><A NAME=1_2>History</A></H2>
 Like many programs <I>HTMLDOC</I> was developed in response to a need 
my company had for generating high-quality documentation in printed and 
electronic forms. For a while we used FrameMaker&reg; and a package from 
Silicon Graphics that generated &quot;compiled&quot; SGML files that could be 
used by the Electronic Book Technologies documentation products (EBT is 
now owned by <A HREF=http://www.inso.com>INSO</A>.) When SGI stopped 
supporting these tools we were stuck. INSO laughed in our faces when we 
said we could afford up to $10k (!) for an updated book generation 
product that would work with the IRIX, Solaris, and HP-UX documentation 
systems. Other solutions were nearly as expensive, or simply not 
capable of doing the things we needed. 
<P>Because of these things I decided to write my own program to 
generate our documentation. HTML seemed to be the source format of 
choice since WYSIWYG HTML editors are widely (and freely) available and 
at worst you can use a plain text editor. We needed HTML output for 
documentation on our web server, PDF for customers to read and/or print 
from their computers, and PostScript for our own printing needs. </P>
<P>The result of my efforts is the <I>HTMLDOC</I> software which is now 
available for UNIX&reg; and Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg;. Among other things, this 
user's guide was produced by <I>HTMLDOC</I>. </P>
<H2><A NAME=1_3>Why Just HTML?</A></H2>
 Some people have asked why this program only deals with HTML input 
files and is not able to read any Standard Generalized Markup Language 
(SGML) file. The reasons are numerous but basically boil down to: 
<OL>
<LI>SGML is a moving target since all SGML documents use Document Type 
Definition (DTD) files to define what markups are actually supported. 
Formatting and processing can become a nightmare if the DTD file 
contains even a single typographic error. Also, this would make the 
front-end parsing code that generates the document markup tree 
considerably larger than it already is, not to mention complicating the 
output code.</LI>
<LI>Tools for SGML file generation cost considerably more than software 
that generates HTML files. Also, the number of HTML tools is at least 
an order of magnitude greater than the number of SGML tools!</LI>
</OL>
 In the future I may add support for XML files, but at present XML has 
very little in the way of tools. Time will tell...

<H1><A NAME=2>1 - Compiling HTMLDOC</A></H1>
</DIV> This chapter describes the steps needed to compile <I>HTMLDOC</I>
 on your system. 
<H2><A NAME=2_1>Getting a Precompiled Executable</A></H2>
 If you don't think you're up to compiling <I>HTMLDOC</I>, or you don't 
have the compiler and libraries listed below, consider downloading a 
precompiled version of <I>HTMLDOC</I>. Precompiled binaries are 
currently available for the following systems: 
<UL>
<LI><A HREF=ftp://ftp.easysw.com/pub/htmldoc/1.8/htmldoc-1.8-dunix.tar.gz>

Windows 95&reg; or Windows NT&reg; 4.0 or higher</A></LI>
</UL>
<H2><A NAME=2_2>Requirements</A></H2>
<I>HTMLDOC</I> requires the following software and libraries: 
<UL>
<LI>C++ compiler (GCC will work)</LI>
<LI><A HREF=ftp://ftp.easysw.com/pub/htmldoc/jpeg>JPEG library</A>, 
version  6 or higher</LI>
<LI><A HREF=ftp://ftp.easysw.com/pub/htmldoc/png>PNG library</A>, 
version  1.0.1 or higher</LI>
<LI><A HREF=ftp://ftp.easysw.com/pub/htmldoc/zlib>GZIP library (zlib)</A>
,  version 1.0.4 or higher</LI>
<LI><A HREF=http://fltk.easysw.com>Fast Light Tool Kit (FLTK)</A>, 
 version 19990107 or newer</LI>
<LI><A HREF=ftp://ftp.x.org>X11 libraries</A>, R5 or higher (UNIX 
 only).</LI>
</UL>
 The GZIP library is used for reading PNG image files as well as 
writing compressed PDF files. GIF reading support is provided by <I>
HTMLDOC</I> source code. 
<P>The JPEG library is used for reading JPEG image files as well as 
writing JPEG-compressed images in Level 2 PostScript and PDF output. </P>
<P>For the Microsoft Windows version of <I>HTMLDOC</I> you'll probably 
need Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0 or higher (other PC compilers <I>may</I>
 work; I didn't have much luck with Borland C++ 5.02). </P>
<H2><A NAME=2_3>Compiling under UNIX</A></H2>
<I>If you are compiling for Windows, see <A HREF=#VISUALC>&quot;Compiling 
with the Visual C++ Project File&quot;</A>.</I>
<P><I>HTMLDOC</I> is built from a single Makefile in the distribution's 
main directory (<I>htmldoc-1.8</I>). To configure the Makefile for your 
system you must run the <I>configure</I> script: </P>
<UL>
<PRE>
% <B>./configure <I>Enter</I></B>
</PRE>
</UL>
 To compile <I>HTMLDOC</I> simply run the &quot;make&quot; command in the <I>
HTMLDOC</I> directory. If you get any fatal errors please send a copy 
of the make/compiler output to <A HREF=mailto:mike@easysw.com>
&quot;mike@easysw.com&quot;</A> for assistance. Please note the version of <I>
HTMLDOC</I> that you are using as well as any pertinent system 
information (operating system, OS version, compiler, etc.) 
<H3><A NAME=2_3_1>Installing the Software</A></H3>
 The Makefile built by the <I>configure</I> script supports 
installation of the program and man pages under <I>/usr/local</I> or a 
directory provided to the <I>configure</I> script using the 
&quot;--prefix=directory&quot; option. 
<P>To install <I>HTMLDOC</I> simply run the &quot;make install&quot; command as 
root. </P>
<H2><A NAME=VISUALC>Compiling with the Visual C++ Project File</A></H2>
 A sample project file for Visual C++ 5.0 is included in the source 
distribution in the file <I>htmldoc.dsp</I>. You will need to change 
the include directories and libraries to point to the directories 
containing the JPEG, PNG, ZLIB, and FLTK libraries. <HR>
<H1 ALIGN=RIGHT><A NAME=3>2 - Guidelines for HTML Source Files</A></H1>
<I>HTMLDOC</I> is capable of processing most HTML files. This chapter 
discusses the requirements for HTML files to be correctly processed by <I>
HTMLDOC</I>
<H2><A NAME=3_1>General Requirements</A></H2>
 Since <I>HTMLDOC</I> is designed as a documentation generation 
program, it expects to have chapters and headers. 
<P><B>NOTE:</B> If you are converting a generic web page you must 
select the &quot;--webpage&quot; option on the command-line or choose &quot;Web Page&quot; 
as the document type in the GUI. </P>
<H2><A NAME=3_2>Page Breaks</A></H2>
 To force a page break use the HR markup with the option &quot;BREAK&quot;: 
<UL>
<PRE>
&lt;HR BREAK&gt;
</PRE>
</UL>
<H2><A NAME=3_3>Chapters</A></H2>
 All chapters start with a top-level heading (H1) markup. Any headings 
within a chapter must be of a lower level (H2 to H7). Each chapter 
starts a new page (the next odd-numbered page if duplexing is 
selected.) 
<H2><A NAME=3_4>Headings</A></H2>
 The headings you use within a chapter must start at level 2 (H2). If 
you skip levels the heading will be shown under the last level that was 
known. For example, if you use the following hierarchy of headings: 
<UL>
<PRE>
&lt;H1&gt;Chapter Heading&lt;/H1&gt;
...
&lt;H2&gt;Section Heading 1&lt;/H2&gt;
...
&lt;H2&gt;Section Heading 2&lt;/H2&gt;
...
&lt;H3&gt;Sub-Section Heading 1&lt;/H3&gt;
...
&lt;H4&gt;Sub-Sub-Section Heading 1&lt;/H4&gt;
...
&lt;H4&gt;Sub-Sub-Section Heading 2&lt;/H4&gt;
...
&lt;H3&gt;Sub-Section Heading 2&lt;/H3&gt;
...
&lt;H2&gt;Section Heading 3&lt;/H2&gt;
...
&lt;H4&gt;Sub-Sub-Section Heading 3&lt;/H4&gt;
...
</PRE>
</UL>
 the table-of-contents that is generated will show: 
<UL><B>Chapter Heading</B>
<UL>
<LI>Section Heading 1</LI>
<LI>Section Heading 2</LI>
<UL>
<LI>Sub-Section Heading 1</LI>
<UL>
<LI>Sub-Sub-Section Heading 1</LI>
<LI>Sub-Sub-Section Heading 2</LI>

<H1 ALIGN=RIGHT><A NAME=5>4 - Generating Documents from the Command-Line</A>
</H1>
 This chapter describes how to generate one or more document files from 
a given set of HTML &quot;source&quot; files using the <I>HTMLDOC</I> software 
from the command-line.  If you are converting web pages from HTML to 
PostScript or PDF format, be sure to look at the <A HREF=#WEB>
Converting Web Pages</A> section. 
<H2><A NAME=5_1>Generating a Single File</A></H2>
 To generate a single file containing the entire document, type the 
following: 
<UL>
<PRE>
% <B>htmldoc -f outfile.html infile1.html infile2.html ...</B>
% <B>htmldoc -f outfile.pdf infile1.html infile2.html ...</B>
% <B>htmldoc -f outfile.ps infile1.html infile2.html ...</B>
</PRE>
</UL>
 The &quot;outfile.html&quot;, &quot;outfile.pdf&quot;, and &quot;outfile.ps&quot; arguments are the 
desired output file. &quot;infile1.html&quot;, &quot;infile2.html&quot;, etc. are your HTML 
source files. 
<P>By default <I>HTMLDOC</I> looks at the extension of the output file 
to determine the output format. Files ending in &quot;.ps&quot; select Level 2 
Adobe&reg; PostScript<SUP>TM</SUP> output. For Level 1 PostScript see <A HREF=#LEVEL1>
&quot;Forcing Level 1 Output&quot;</A> below. </P>
<H2><A NAME=5_2>Generating Multiple Files</A></H2>
 To generate multiple files for the document, type the following: 
<UL>
<PRE>
% <B>htmldoc -d outdir -t html infile1.html infile2.html ...</B>
% <B>htmldoc -d outdir -t ps1 infile1.html infile2.html ...</B>
% <B>htmldoc -d outdir -t ps2 infile1.html infile2.html ...</B>
</PRE>
</UL>
 The &quot;outdir&quot; argument is the desired output directory. The &quot;-t html&quot;, 
&quot;-t ps1&quot;, and &quot;-t ps2&quot; arguments select HTML and PostScript output, 
respectively. &quot;infile1.html&quot;, &quot;infile2.html&quot;, etc. are your HTML source 
files. A separate HTML or PostScript file (doc####.html or doc####.ps) 
will be created for each chapter (H1 heading) in the document as well 
as a table of contents file (index.html or index.ps). For HTML output, 
all local image files that are referenced in the document will be 
copied to the output directory as well. 
<P><B>Multiple output files are currently not supported for PDF output.</B>

<H3><A NAME=5_6_4>Setting the Page Size</A></H3>
 The &quot;--size&quot; option specifies the output page size: 
<UL>
<PRE>
% <B>htmldoc --size letter ...</B>
% <B>htmldoc --size a4 ...</B>
% <B>htmldoc --size universal ...</B>
% <B>htmldoc --size WIDTHxHEIGHT ...</B>
% <B>htmldoc --size WIDTHxHEIGHTin ...</B>
% <B>htmldoc --size WIDTHxHEIGHTcm ...</B>
% <B>htmldoc --size WIDTHxHEIGHTmm ...</B>
</PRE>
</UL>
 The &quot;WIDTH&quot; and &quot;HEIGHT&quot; arguments can be in points (no units 
specified), inches, centimeters, or millimeters. The default page size 
is Universal (8.27x11in or 210x279mm) which is the minimum of the US 
and European standard sizes (Letter and A4, respectively). 
<P>Note that this does not select a media size on the printer but 
merely adjusts the formatting so that the text and images appear within 
the given page area. You must still select the appropriate media size 
in your printer driver or on the printer itself. </P>
<H3><A NAME=5_6_5>Setting the Page Margins</A></H3>
 The &quot;--left&quot;, &quot;--right&quot;, &quot;--top&quot;, and &quot;--bottom&quot; options control the 
page margins of the output. The defaults are 1 inch (25mm) for the left 
and 0.5 inches (12mm) for the right, top, and bottom margins. 
<H3><A NAME=5_6_6>Setting the Default Font Typeface and Size</A></H3>
 The default font size, spacing, and typefaces are controlled by the 
&quot;--fontsize&quot;, &quot;--fontspacing&quot;, &quot;--bodyfont&quot;, and &quot;--headingfont&quot; 
options: 
<UL>
<PRE>
% <B>htmldoc --fontsize 9.0 --fontspacing 2.0 ...</B>
% <B>htmldoc --bodyfont helvetica ...</B>
% <B>htmldoc --headingfont times ...</B>
</PRE>
</UL>
 The typefaces for &quot;--bodyfont&quot; and &quot;--headingfont&quot; can be &quot;courier&quot;, 
&quot;times&quot;, or &quot;helvetica&quot;. 
<H3><A NAME=5_6_7>Customizing the Page Headers and Footers</A></H3>
 The &quot;--header&quot; and &quot;--footer&quot; options allow you to customize the 
headers and footers used for the document body.  Each option requires a 
three character string that specifies the left, middle, and right 
fields: 
<CENTER>
<TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH=50%>
<TR><TH WIDTH=60>Char</TH><TH>Description</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>.</TD><TD>A period indicates that the field should be blank.</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD>t</TD><TD>A &quot;t&quot; indicates that the field should contain the 
document title.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>h</TD><TD>An &quot;h&quot; indicates that the field should contain the 
current heading.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>l</TD><TD>A lowercase L indicates that the field should contain 
the logo  image.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>1</TD><TD>The number 1 indicates that the field should contain 
the current  page number in decimal format (1, 2, 3, ...)</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>i</TD><TD>A lowercase I indicates that the field should contain 
the current  page number in lowercase roman numerals (i, ii, iii, ...)</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD>I</TD><TD>An uppercase I indicates that the field should 
contain the current  page number in uppercase roman numerals (I, II, 
III, ...)</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
 The &quot;--tocheader&quot; and &quot;--tocfooter&quot; options control the header and 
footer on table-of-contents pages. 
<H3><A NAME=5_6_8>Setting the Header and Footer Font</A></H3>
 The &quot;--headfootsize&quot; and &quot;--headfootfont&quot; options set the size and 
typeface of the font used for the page headers and footers: 
<UL>
<PRE>
% <B>htmldoc --headfootsize 9.0 --headfootfont courier ...</B>
</PRE>
</UL>
<H3><A NAME=5_6_9>Disabling Document Compression</A></H3>
 Normally each page in a PDF file is compressed using the Flate method 
(GZIP). Versions of Acrobat Reader prior to 3.0 do not understand Flate 
compression. To disable compression use the &quot;--no-compression&quot; option. <HR>
<H1 ALIGN=RIGHT><A NAME=6>A - Implementation Limits</A></H1>
<I>HTMLDOC</I> current has the following implementation limits: 
<UL>
<LI>Generated PostScript/PDF pages: 5000</LI>
<LI>Chapters: 100</LI>
<LI>Headings: 10000</LI>
<LI>Links: 20000</LI>
<LI>Table columns: 20</LI>
<LI>Table rows: 1000</LI>
</UL>
 This limits can be increased by changing the appropriate constant 
definition in the <I>config.h</I> header file. <HR>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
<BR> Version 2, June 1991</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<BR> 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA
<BR> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of 
this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
<BR> TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</B></P>
<P>0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains 
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed 
under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below, 
refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot; 
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: 
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, 
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another 
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in 
the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</P>
<P>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not 
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of 
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program 
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program 
(independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that 
is true depends on what the Program does.</P>
<P>1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's 
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you 
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate 
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the 
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; 
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License 
along with the Program.</P>
<P>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, 
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a 
fee.</P>
<P>2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion 
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and 
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</P>
<UL>
<P>a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent  notices 
stating that you changed the files and the date of any  change.</P>
<P>b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish,  that in 
whole or in part contains or is derived from the  Program or any part 
thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no  charge to all third parties 
under the terms of this  License.</P>
<P>c. If the modified program normally reads commands  interactively 
when run, you must cause it, when started running  for such interactive 
use in the most ordinary way, to print or  display an announcement 
including an appropriate copyright  notice and a notice that there is 
no warranty (or else, saying  that you provide a warranty) and that 
users may redistribute  the program under these conditions, and telling 
the user how to  view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the 
Program itself  is interactive but does not normally print such an 
 announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to  print 
an announcement.)</P>
</UL>
<P>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If 
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, 
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in 
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those 
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you 
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based 
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of 
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the 
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote 
it.</P>
<P>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or 
contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent 
is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or 
collective works based on the Program.</P>
<P>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the 
Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a 
volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other 
work under the scope of this License.</P>
<P>3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, 
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of 
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</P>
<UL>
<P>a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding  machine-readable 
source code, which must be distributed under  the terms of Sections 1 
and 2 above on a medium customarily  used for software interchange; or,</P>
<P>b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three 
 years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your  cost 
of physically performing source distribution, a complete 
 machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be 
 distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a  medium 
customarily used for software interchange; or,</P>
<P>c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the  offer 
to distribute corresponding source code.  (This  alternative is allowed 
only for noncommercial distribution and  only if you received the 
program in object code or executable  form with such an offer, in 
accord with Subsection b above.)</P>
</UL>
<P>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for 
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source 
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any 
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control 
compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a special 
exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that 
is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the 
major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system 
on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies 
the executable.</P>
<P>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering 
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access 
to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of 
the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy 
the source along with the object code.</P>
<P>4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program 
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise 
to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will 
automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, 
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this 
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties 
remain in full compliance.</P>
<P>5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not 
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or 
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are 
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by 
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the 
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and 
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the 
Program or works based on it.</P>
<P>6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the 
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the 
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to 
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further 
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. 
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to 
this License.</P>
<P>7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), 
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not 
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot 
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this 
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you 
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent 
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by 
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then 
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to 
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</P>
<P>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable 
under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is 
intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in 
other circumstances.</P>
<P>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any 
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any 
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the 
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is 
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made 
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed 
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that 
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing 
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot 
impose that choice.</P>
<P>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed 
to be a consequence of the rest of this License.</P>
<P>8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in 
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the 
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may 
add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those 
countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries 
not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the 
limitation as if written in the body of this License.</P>
<P>9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new 
versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new 
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may 
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</P>
<P>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the 
Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it 
and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and 
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by 
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a 
version number of this License, you may choose any version ever 
published by the Free Software Foundation.</P>
<P>10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free 
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the 
author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the 
Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we 
sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the 
two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free 
software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>NO WARRANTY</B></P>
<P>11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO 
WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. 
 EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR 
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, 
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED 
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. 
 THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS 
WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF 
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</P>
<P>12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN 
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY 
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU 
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE 
PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING 
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A 
FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF 
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH 
DAMAGES.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</B></P>
