About This Software</H2>
This document describes how to use the <I>HTMLDOC</I> software, version
1.8. <I>HTMLDOC</I> is a HTML document processing program that generates
indexed HTML, Adobe&reg; PostScript<SUP>TM</SUP>, and Adobe Portable Document
Format (PDF 1.2) files suitable for printing or online viewing.

<P>No restrictions are placed upon the output produced by <I>HTMLDOC</I>.

<H2>History</H2>

Like many programs <I>HTMLDOC</I> was developed in response to a need
my company had for generating high-quality documentation in printed and
electronic forms. For a while we used FrameMaker&reg; and a package
from Silicon Graphics that generated "compiled" SGML files that could
be used by the Electronic Book Technologies documentation products (EBT
is now owned by <A HREF="http://www.inso.com">INSO</A>.) When SGI
stopped supporting these tools we were stuck. INSO laughed in our faces
when we said we could afford up to $10k (!) for an updated book
generation product that would work with the IRIX, Solaris, and HP-UX
documentation systems. Other solutions were nearly as expensive, or
simply not capable of doing the things we needed.

<P>Because of these things I decided to write my own program to generate
our documentation. HTML seemed to be the source format of choice since
WYSIWYG HTML editors are widely (and freely) available and at worst you
can use a plain text editor. We needed HTML output for documentation on
our web server, PDF for customers to read and/or print from their computers,
and PostScript for our own printing needs.

<P>The result of my efforts is the <I>HTMLDOC</I> software which is now
available for UNIX&reg; and Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg;. Among other
things, this user's guide was produced by <I>HTMLDOC</I>.

<H2>Why Just HTML?</H2>

Some people have asked why this program only deals with HTML input files
and is not able to read any Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)
file. The reasons are numerous but basically boil down to:

<OL>
<LI>
SGML is a moving target since all SGML documents use Document Type Definition
(DTD) files to define what markups are actually supported. Formatting and
processing can become a nightmare if the DTD file contains even a single
typographic error. Also, this would make the front-end parsing code that
generates the document markup tree considerably larger than it already
is, not to mention complicating the output code.</LI>

<LI>
Tools for SGML file generation cost considerably more than software that
generates HTML files. Also, the number of HTML tools is at least an order
of magnitude greater than the number of SGML tools!</LI>
</OL>

In the future I may add support for XML files, but at present XML has very
little in the way of tools. Time will tell...
