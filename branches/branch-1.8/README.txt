INTRODUCTION

    This README file describes HTMLDOC, a HTML processing program that
    generates HTML, PostScript, and PDF files with a table of contents.

    Commercial support for HTMLDOC is available from Easy Software
    Products for $495 US.  Besides giving you priority bug fixes and
    guaranteed support, the commercial support fee includes access to a
    "members only" web site that provides examples, tutorials, and tips
    for using HTMLDOC to publish documents on your web site.

    HTMLDOC is copyright 1997-2001 by Easy Software Products and is
    currently available under the GNU General Public License, version
    2.  See the LEGAL STUFF section below for details.

    **** PLEASE READ THE DOCUMENTATION BEFORE ASKING QUESTIONS. ****

    Documentation for HTMLDOC is available in the "doc" subdirectory
    and is been generated from HTML "source" files into HTML,
    PostScript, and PDF using HTMLDOC.

    HTMLDOC supports most HTML 3.2 and some HTML 4.0 markups as well as
    GIF, JPEG, and PNG images.  Eventually HTMLDOC will be compliant
    with HTML 4.0 and support style sheets.

    See the file "COMPILE.txt" for instructions on compiling HTMLDOC
    from the source code.


INSTALLING HTMLDOC UNDER MICROSOFT WINDOWS

    HTMLDOC comes in a self-extracting archive.  Double-click on or run
    the "htmldoc-1.8.13-windows.exe" or "htmldoc-1.8.13-winfree.exe" files
    to start the installation wizard.

    (the -windows file is the supported version, while the -winfree file
     is the unsupported version)


INSTALLING HTMLDOC UNDER RED HAT LINUX

    Type the following command to install HTMLDOC under Red Hat Linux:

        rpm -i htmldoc-1.8.13-linux-2.0-intel.rpm ENTER

    or:

        rpm -i htmldoc-1.8.13-linux-2.2-intel.rpm ENTER


INSTALLING HTMLDOC UNDER UNIX

    Type the following commands to install HTMLDOC under UNIX:

        gunzip htmldoc-1.8.13-platform.tar.gz ENTER
	tar xf htmldoc-1.8.13-platform.tar ENTER
	./setup ENTER *or* ./htmldoc.install ENTER

    (replace "platform" with the appropriate platform name)


RUNNING HTMLDOC FROM THE COMMAND-LINE

    HTMLDOC accepts a list of HTML "source" files and will generate
    HTML, PostScript, or PDF output via command-line options.  A
    summary of command-line options can be shown with the "--help"
    option:

        htmldoc --help

    HTMLDOC normally expects "structured" documents, with chapters,
    etc.  Chapters begin with a <H1> markup and continue to the end of
    the listed HTML files or the next <H1> markup, whichever comes
    first.  To convert unstructured documents such as web pages, use
    the "--webpage" option to HTMLDOC:

        htmldoc --webpage ...

    To generate a Level 2 PostScript file you might use:

        htmldoc -f outfile.ps chapter1.html ... chapterN.html

    Similarly you can generate a PDF file of the same source files
    using:

        htmldoc -f outfile.pdf chapter1.html ... chapterN.html

    Finally, to generate HTML files for viewing (with a linked table-
    of-contents) do the following:

        htmldoc -t html -d outdir chapter1.html ... chapterN.html

    or:

        htmldoc -t html -f outfile.html chapter1.html ... chapterN.html

    A complete description of all command-line options and HTML
    guidelines can be found in the software users manual in the "doc"
    directory.


RUNNING THE GUI SOFTWARE

    To run the UNIX GUI type:

        htmldoc ENTER

    To run the Windows GUI choose "HTMLDOC" from the "Start" menu.

    This version of HTMLDOC reads and writes "book" files containing a
    list of HTML source files and a set of output options.  Eventually
    the GUI will support multiple output files so you can automagically
    generate N files, each formatted differently.


RUNNING HTMLDOC FROM YOUR WEB SERVER

    HTMLDOC supports filtering of documents from stdin to stdout.  This
    can be useful for producing PDF or PostScript versions of HTML
    reports on your web server.

    The special filename "-" specifies the standard input or standard
    output.  To filter web pages to PDF use the command:
    
         htmldoc --webpage -t pdf -

    Note that this does not handle sending the "Content-Type:
    application/pdf" header, so if you do this in a CGI script you'll
    need to send this header prior to running htmldoc.  See Chapter 5
    for more information.


CURRENT LIMITATIONS

    - No support for style sheets.
    - CAPTIONs are always shown at the top of the table.
    - HTML 4.0 table elements and attributes are not supported
      (rules, THEAD, TFOOT, etc.)
