<H1 ALIGN="RIGHT"><A NAME="CGI">Chapter 5 - Using HTMLDOC on a Web Server</A></H1>

This chapter describes how to interface HTMLDOC to your web server using CGI
scripts and programs.

<H2>The Basics</H2>

<I>HTMLDOC</I> can be used in a variety of ways to generate
formatted reports on a web server. The most common way is to
combine <I>HTMLDOC</I> with a CGI script or program and send the
output to the HTTP client.

<P>To make this work the CGI script or program must send the
appropriate HTTP attributes, the required empty line to signify
the beginning of the document, and then execute the
<I>HTMLDOC</I> program to generate the HTML, PostScript, or PDF
file as needed.

<P>Another way to generate PDF files from your reports is to use
<I>HTMLDOC</I> as a "portal" application. When used as a portal,
<I>HTMLDOC</I> automatically retrieves the named document or
report from your server and passes a PDF version to the web
browser. See the next section for more information.

<H2>Calling HTMLDOC from a Shell Script</H2>

Shell scripts are probably the easiest to work with, but are normally
limited to GET type requests. Here is a script called
<VAR>topdf</VAR> that acts as a portal, converting the named file to PDF:

<UL><PRE>
#!/bin/sh
#
# Sample "portal" script to convert the named HTML file to PDF on-the-fly.
#
# Usage: http://www.domain.com/path/topdf/path/filename.html
#

#
# The "options" variable contains any options you want to pass to HTMLDOC.
#

options="-t pdf --webpage --header ... --footer ..."

#
# Tell the browser to expect a PDF file...
#

echo "Content-Type: application/pdf"
echo ""

#
# Run HTMLDOC to generate the PDF file...
#

htmldoc $options http://${SERVER_NAME}:${SERVER_PORT}$PATH_INFO
</PRE></UL>

<P>Users of this CGI would reference the URL
"http://www.domain.com/topdf.cgi/index.html" to generate a PDF file of the
site's home page.

<H2>Calling HTMLDOC from Perl</H2>

<P>Perl scripts offer the ability to generate more complex reports, pull
data from databases, etc. The easiest way to interface Perl scripts
with <I>HTMLDOC</I> is to write a report to a temporary file and then
execute <I>HTMLDOC</I> to generate the PDF file.

<P>Here is a simple Perl subroutine that can be used to write a PDF report
to the HTTP client:

<UL><PRE>
sub topdf(filename);

sub topdf {
    my $filename = shift;

    print "Content-Type: application/pdf\n\n";
    system "htmldoc -t pdf --webpage $filename";
}
</PRE></UL>

<H2>Calling HTMLDOC from C</H2>

<P>C programs offer the best flexibility and easily support on-the-fly
report generation without the need for temporary files.

<P>Here are some simple C functions that can be used to generate a PDF
report to the HTTP client from a temporary file or pipe:

<UL><PRE>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;


/* topdf() - convert a HTML file to PDF */
FILE *topdf(const char *filename)	/* HTML file to convert */
{
  char	command[1024];			/* Command to execute */


  puts("Content-Type: application/pdf\n");

  sprintf(command, "htmldoc -t pdf --webpage %s", filename);

  return (popen(command, "w"));
}


/* topdf2() - pipe HTML output to HTMLDOC for conversion to PDF */
FILE *topdf2(void)
{
  puts("Content-Type: application/pdf\n");
  return (popen("htmldoc -t pdf --webpage -", "w"));
}
</PRE></UL>
