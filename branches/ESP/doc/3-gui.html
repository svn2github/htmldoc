This chapter describes how to generate document files from a given set
of HTML "source" files using the <I>HTMLDOC</I> GUI.

<H2>The HTMLDOC GUI</H2>

The <I>HTMLDOC</I> GUI (Figures 2 through 7) is contained in a single window
showing the input, output, and generation options. At the bottom are buttons
to load, save, and generate documents.

<H2>Document File Operations</H2>

<H3>Starting a New Document</H3>

To start a new document, click on the <I>New</I> button.

<H3>Opening an Existing Document</H3>

To open a document you've saved previously, click on the <I>Open...</I>
button.

<H3>Saving the Current Document</H3>

To save the current document, click on the <I>Save</I> button. If you have
never saved the document before or would like to save it with a new filename,
click on the <I>Save As...</I> button instead.

<H2>Generating Your Document</H2>

To generate your document, click on the <I>Generate</I> button. The progress
meter at the bottom of the window will show the progress as each page is
written.

<H2>Exiting from the HTMLDOC GUI</H2>

To exit from the <I>HTMLDOC</I> GUI, click on the <I>Close</I> button.

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="htmldoc-input.gif"><BR>
Figure 2 - HTMLDOC Window and Input Tab</P>

<H2>The Input Tab</H2>

<H3>Setting the Document Type</H3>

Normally <I>HTMLDOC</I> generates indexed documents from your HTML files.  To
convert a single "web page" click on the <I>Web Page</I> radio button.

<H3>Adding HTML Input Files</H3>

Click on the <I>Add...</I> button to add an HTML file to your document.

<H3>Deleting HTML Input Files</H3>

To remove one or more HTML files from your document, click on the file
(or drag multiple files) in the input file list and then click on the <I>Delete</I>
button. The files are removed from your document but are <I>not</I> deleted
from your disk.

<H3>Editing HTML Input Files</H3>

To edit one or more HTML files in your document, click on the file (or
drag multiple files) in the input file list and then click on the <I>Edit...</I>
button. By default this starts the <I>nedit</I> editor under UNIX
and the <I>Notepad</I> editor under Windows. See <A HREF=#OPTIONS>"The Options
Tab"</A> later in this chapter for details on how to change the editor that is
used.

<H3>Moving HTML Input Files</H3>

To change the order of the input files, click on a file to move (or drag
multiple files) in the input file list and then click on the <I>Move Up</I>
or <I>Move Down</I> button.

<H3>Selecting a Logo Image</H3>

The logo image is shown on the title page of PostScript and PDF output
files and in the navigation bar of HTML files. To select a logo image file,
click on the <I>Browse</I> button. After the standard file selection dialog
appears, double-click on the desired image file.

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="htmldoc-output.gif"><BR>
Figure 3 - HTMLDOC Output Tab</P>

<H2>The Output Tab </H2>

<H3>Selecting File or Directory Generation</H3>

<I>HTMLDOC</I> can generate a single HTML or PostScript file or a series of
files, one per chapter plus the table of contents (index) file. To select single
file output click on the <I>File</I> radio button. To generate multiple files to
a directory click on the <I>Directory</I> radio button.

<H3>Selecting an Output File or Directory</H3>

The output file is the HTML, PostScript, or PDF file you wish to
generate from your HTML files. To select an output file, click on the
<I>Browse</I> button. After the file selection dialog appears, type the
name of the file you would like to create.

<H3>Selecting the Output Format</H3>

To select an output format, click on the corresponding <I>Output Type</I>
button. Be careful when generating Level 2 PostScript output, as Level
1 PostScript printers do not support the Level 2 image commands generated
by <I>HTMLDOC</I> (most printers manufactured in the last 4 years are Level
2).

<P><B>NOTE:</B> Choose Level 2 PostScript output for Level 3 PostScript
printers.

<H3>Selecting Grayscale Output</H3>

When generating PostScript or PDF files you can choose to convert all images
to grayscale.  This is necessary for many Level 1 printers that do not support
color images and can reduce the size of output files considerably.

<P>To select grayscale output, click on the <I>Grayscale</I> button.

<H3>Selecting Compressed Output</H3>

PDF files are compressed using Flate (a.k.a. ZIP) compression by default. If
you need to view the PDF files produced by <I>HTMLDOC</I> with an older version
of Acrobat Reader (2.x or earlier) click on the <I>Compression</I> toggle button
to turn compression off.

<H3>Disabling the Title Page</H3>

A title page is generated for your document by default. To turn the title page
off, click on the <I>Title Page</I> toggle button.

<H3>Using JPEG Compression</H3>

<I>HTMLDOC</I> supports JPEG compression of large images when generating Level
2 PostScript and PDF files.  To enable JPEG compression, click on the <I>JPEG
Big Images</I> toggle button.  The output quality can be controlled by
dragging the <I>JPEG Quality</I> slider in the options tab.

<P>Once you have enabled JPEG compression, any color image that cannot be
converted to an 8-bit (or less) colormapped image will be JPEG'd.  Similarly,
any grayscale image that cannot be represented by 16 (or less) shades will be
JPEG'd.

<P>JPEG compression can dramatically reduce the size of output files, however
with low quality settings the images can look blotchy.

<H3>Changing the Navigation Bar Color</H3>

To change the color of the navigation bar used in HTML output, type in a color
name in the <I>Bar Color</I> field or click on the <I>Lookup...</I> button to
graphically pick a color.

Figure 4 - HTMLDOC Window and Page Tab</P>

<H2>The Page Tab</H2>

<H3>Selecting a Page Size</H3>

The page size option is only available for PostScript and PDF output.
<I>HTMLDOC</I> supports the following standard page size names:

<UL>
	<LI>Letter - 8.5x11in (216x279mm)
	<LI>A4 - 8.27x11.69in (210x297mm)
	<LI>Universal - 8.27x11in (210x279mm)
</UL>

<P>To select a custom page size, double-click on the page size text and
enter the page width and length separated by the letter "x". Append the
letters "in" for inches, "mm" for millimeters, or "cm" for centimeters.

<H3>Selecting Double-Sided Output</H3>

To select double-sided (duplexed) output click on the <I>Double-Sided</I>
toggle button.

<P><B>NOTE:</B> This option does not select duplexing on the printer, it only
generates pages with the left/right margins swapped on even numbered pages and
forces all chapters (and the table-of-contents) to start on an odd-numbered
page.  You must still select duplexing from your application or printer options.

<H3>Setting the Page Margins</H3>

The left, right, top, and bottom margins can be changed by clicking in the
appropriate text field and entering a new margin.  Append the letters "in" for
inches, "mm" for millimeters, or "cm" for centimeters.

<H3>Customizing the Header and Footer</H3>

To customize the header and footer for the document/body pages, select the
desired text from each of the option buttons.  The leftmost option buttons
set the text that is left-justified, while the middle buttons set the text that
is centered and the right buttons set the text that is right-justified.
