<P>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
 to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses
 are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
 software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.</P>
<P>This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
 specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
 other libraries whose authors decide to use it. You can use it for your
 libraries, too.</P>
<P>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
 if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in
 new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</P>
<P>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
 anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
 These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
 distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.</P>
<P>For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
 or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
 you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
 code. If you link a program with the library, you must provide complete
 object files to the recipients so that they can relink them with the
 library, after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And
 you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</P>
<P>Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the
 library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
 permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</P>
<P>Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that
 everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free library.
 If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its
 recipients to know that what they have is not the original version, so
 that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
 authors' reputations.</P>
<P>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
 patents. We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
 software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
 transforming the program into proprietary software. To prevent this, we
 have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free
 use or not licensed at all.</P>
<P>Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
 ordinary GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility
 programs. This license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies
 to certain designated libraries. This license is quite different from
 the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that
 anything in it is the same as in the ordinary license.</P>
<P>The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is
 that they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or
 adding to a program and simply using it. Linking a program with a
 library, without changing the library, is in some sense simply using
 the library, and is analogous to running a utility program or
 application program. However, in a textual and legal sense, the linked
 executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original library,
 and the ordinary General Public License treats it as such.</P>
<P>Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
 Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
 sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. We
 concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.</P>
<P>However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
 users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
 libraries themselves. This Library General Public License is intended
 to permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
 preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
 libraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not seen how to
 achieve this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved
 it as regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.) The hope
 is that this will lead to faster development of free libraries.</P>
<P>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a
 &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The
 former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
 works together with the library.</P>
<P>Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
 General Public License rather than by this special one.</P>
