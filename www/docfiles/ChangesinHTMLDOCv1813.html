<H2><A NAME="12_15">Changes in HTMLDOC v1.8.13</A></H2>
<UL>
<H3><A NAME="12_15_1">New Features</A></H3>
<LI>Added support for secure (https) URLs via the OpenSSL library.</LI>
<LI>Added support for Acrobat 5.0 (PDF 1.4).</LI>
<LI>Added support for transparency in PostScript and PDF 1.1 and 1.2
 output.</LI>
<LI>Added a --no-jpeg option (same as --jpeg=0)</LI>
<LI>Added support for the CSS2 page-break-before and page-break-after
 properties.</LI>
<LI>Added a PHP example.</LI>
<H3><A NAME="12_15_2">Changes</A></H3>
<LI>External file references to non-PDF files now use the &quot;Launch&quot;
 action so they can be opened/executed/saved as allowed by the OS and
 PDF viewer.</LI>
<LI>Changed the indexed/JPEG'd transition point to 256 colors when using
 Flate compression. This makes PDF files much smaller in general.</LI>
<LI>Changed the in-line image size limit to 64k.</LI>
<LI>Now allow &quot;&lt;&quot; followed by whitespace, &quot;=&quot;, or &quot;&lt;&quot;. This violates the
 HTML specification, but we're sick of people complaining about it.</LI>
<LI>Preferences are now stored in a user-specific file under Windows,
 just like UNIX. This provides user-specific preferences and allows
 preferences to be kept when upgrading to new versions of HTMLDOC.</LI>
<LI>The book loading code now allows for blank lines, even though these
 are not a part of the format. (added to support some scripted apps that
 include extra newlines...)</LI>
<LI>Changed the leading space handling of blocks to more closely match
 the standard browser behavior.</LI>
<H3><A NAME="12_15_3">Bug Fixes</A></H3>
<LI>The table formatting code adding the border width to the cell width,
 while Netscape and MSIE don't. This caused some interesting formatting
 glitches...</LI>
<LI>The table formatting code didn't account for the preferred width of
 colspan'd cells.</LI>
<LI>The table formatting code tried to enforce the minimum cell width
 when squeezing a table to fit on the page; this caused the table to
 still exceed the width of the page.</LI>
<LI>The PDF catalog object could contain a reference to a /Names object
 of &quot;0 0 R&quot;, which is invalid. This would happen when the &quot;--no-links&quot;
 option was used.</LI>
<LI>Several HTML elements were incorrectly written with closing tags.</LI>
<LI>When piping PDF output, the temporary file that is created needed to
 be open for reading and writing, but HTMLDOC only opened the file for
 writing.</LI>
<LI>Image links did not work.</LI>
<LI>The JPEG image loading code did not correctly handle grayscale JPEG
 images.</LI>
<LI>JPEG images were not encrypted when writing a document with
 encryption enabled.</LI>
<LI>The user password was not properly encrypted.</LI>
<LI>The colormap of indexed images were not encrypted when writing a
 document with encryption enabled.</LI>
<LI>The temporary file creation and cleanup functions did not use the
 same template under Windows, causing multiple conversions to fail when
 temporary files were used.</LI>
<LI>Paragraphs could end up with one extra text fragment, causing the
 line to be too long.</LI>
<LI>The command-line program would clear the error count after reading
 all the files/URLs on the command-line, but before generating the
 document. If there were problems reading the files/URLs, HTMLDOC would
 return a 0 exit status instead of 1.</LI>
<LI>Image objects that were both JPEG and Flate compressed would not
 display (filters specified in the wrong order.)</LI>
<LI>Images with more than 256 colors would cause a segfault on some
 systems.</LI>
<LI>Background images would generate the error message &quot;XObject 'Innn'
 is unknown&quot;.</LI>
