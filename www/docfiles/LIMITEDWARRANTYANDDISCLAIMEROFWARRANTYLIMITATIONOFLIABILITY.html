<H3><A NAME="10_2_2">LIMITED WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY;
 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</A></H3>
<P>ESP warrants that it has the authority and right to license the
 SOFTWARE, and that the SOFTWARE will conform to the material printed
 specifications therefore which are in effect on the date of original
 delivery of such SOFTWARE. ESP's warranty and obligation shall extend
 for a period of ninety (90) days after the date of the original
 delivery of SOFTWARE to LICENSEE by ESP, and is solely for the benefit
 of LICENSEE, who has no authority to assign or pass through this
 warranty to any other person or entity.</P>
<P>Except as provided in this Section, the SOFTWARE is provided to
 LICENSEE on an &quot;AS IS&quot; basis, and ESP makes no other warranty of any
 kind, express or implied, with regard to the SOFTWARE licensed
 hereunder. ESP warrants that the SOFTWARE properly processes date and
 time information between the years 1970 and 2038. ESP does not warrant
 or represent that the SOFTWARE will operate uninterrupted or error free
 or that all defects in the SOFTWARE are correctable or will be
 corrected. This warranty shall not apply if SOFTWARE is used other than
 in accordance with ESP's written instructions, or if any of LICENSEE's
 hardware equipment or other software malfunctions. ESP's entire
 liability and LICENSEE's exclusive remedy for any defects in the
 SOFTWARE shall be to obtain ESP's SOFTWARE updates via the Internet or
 pay a media update fee for each copy of the SOFTWARE.</P>
<P>THE FORGOING WARRANTIES ARE IN LIEU OF, AND ESP DISCLAIMS, ALL OTHER
 WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
 WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Some
 states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so the
 exclusion above may not apply to LICENSEE. This warranty gives LICENSEE
 specific legal rights, and LICENSEE may have other rights which vary
 from state to state.</P>
<P>IN NO EVENT SHALL ESP OR ESP'S LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE FOR
 ANY SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES OF ANY KIND
 (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSS OF PROFITS OR DATA AND PERSONAL
 INJURY), WHETHER OR NOT ESP HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
 LOSS, HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF
 THIS AGREEMENT. THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE
 FAILURE OF THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY. In no event
 will ESP be liable for any claim against LICENSEE by a third party, and
 LICENSEE hereby agrees to indemnify and hold ESP harmless for any
 claims for cost, damage, expense or liability arising out of or in
 connection with the installation, use and performance of the SOFTWARE
 licensed hereunder, whether alone or in combination with any other
 product or service. Some states do not allow the limitation or
 exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the
 limitation above may not apply to LICENSEE.</P>
