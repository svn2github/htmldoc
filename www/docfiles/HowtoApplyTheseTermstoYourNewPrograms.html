<H3><A NAME="10_1_5">How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</A></H3>
<P>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
 possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
 free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
 terms.</P>
<P>To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
 to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
 convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
 the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</P>
<PRE>
<VAR>one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.</VAR>
Copyright (C) <VAR>yyyy</VAR>  <VAR>name of author</VAR>

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License

but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software

</PRE>
<P>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
 mail.</P>
<P>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like
 this when it starts in an interactive mode:</P>
<PRE>
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) <VAR>year</VAR> <VAR>name of author</VAR>
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome
to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'
for details.
</PRE>
<P>The hypothetical commands <SAMP>`show w'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`show c'</SAMP>
 should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of
 course, the commands you use may be called something other than <SAMP>
`show w'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`show c'</SAMP>; they could even be
 mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.</P>
<P>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
 your school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program,
 if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:</P>
<PRE>
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright
interest in the program `Gnomovision'
