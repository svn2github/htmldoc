<P>Like many programs, I developed HTMLDOC in response to a need my
 company had for generating high-quality documentation in printed and
 electronic forms. For a while I used FrameMaker&reg; and a package from <CODE>
sgi</CODE> that generated &quot;compiled&quot; Standard Generalized Markup
 Language (&quot;SGML&quot;) files that could be used by the Electronic Book
 Technologies (&quot;EBT&quot;) documentation products; EBT was bought by INSO who
 was bought by Stellent<SUP>TM</SUP> who apparently has dropped the
 whole product line. When <CODE>sgi</CODE> stopped supporting these
 tools I turned to INSO, but the cost of their tools was prohibitive to
 my small business.</P>
<P>In the end I decided to write my own program to generate the
 documentation. HTML seemed to be the source format of choice since
 WYSIWYG HTML editors are widely (and freely) available and at worst you
 can use a plain text editor. I needed HTML output for documentation on
 my web server, PDF for customers to read and/or print from their
 computers, and PostScript for printing needs.</P>
<P>The result of my efforts is the HTMLDOC software which is available
 for Linux&reg;/UNIX&reg;, MacOS&reg; X, and Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg;. Among other
 things, this software users manual is produced using HTMLDOC.</P>
<P>HTMLDOC used to be available under a commercial end-user license
 agreement from my former company, Easy Software Products. While that
 company is no longer in business, I continue to maintain and develop
 HTMLDOC in my spare time.</P>
