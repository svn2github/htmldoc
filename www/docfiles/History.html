<P>Like many programs HTMLDOC was developed in response to a need our
 company had for generating high-quality documentation in printed and
 electronic forms. For a while we used FrameMaker&reg; and a package from <CODE>
sgi</CODE> that generated &quot;compiled&quot; Standard Generalized Markup
 Language (&quot;SGML&quot;) files that could be used by the Electronic Book
 Technologies (&quot;EBT&quot;) documentation products; EBT was bought by INSO who
 was bought by Stellent<SUP>TM</SUP> who apparently has dropped the
 whole product line. When <CODE>sgi</CODE> stopped supporting these
 tools we turned to INSO, but the cost of their tools is prohibitive to
 small businesses.</P>
<P>In the end we decided to write our own program to generate our
 documentation. HTML seemed to be the source format of choice since
 WYSIWYG HTML editors are widely (and freely) available and at worst you
 can use a plain text editor. We needed HTML output for documentation on
 our web server, PDF for customers to read and/or print from their
 computers, and PostScript for our own printing needs.</P>
<P>The result of our efforts is the HTMLDOC software which is available
 for Linux&reg;/UNIX&reg;, MacOS&reg; X, and Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg;. Among other
 things, this software users manual is produced using HTMLDOC.</P>
