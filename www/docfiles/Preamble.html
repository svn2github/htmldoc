<P>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
 to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
 intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
 software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This
 General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
 Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
 using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
 the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
 your programs, too.</P>
<P>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
 if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in
 new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</P>
<P>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
 anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
 These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
 distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</P>
<P>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
 gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
 you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
 source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their
 rights.</P>
<P>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
 and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to
 copy, distribute and/or modify the software.</P>
<P>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
 that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
 software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
 want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
 that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
 authors' reputations.</P>
<P>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
 patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
 program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
 program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
 patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.</P>
<P>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow.</P>
