<H2><A NAME="12_16">Changes in HTMLDOC v1.8.12</A></H2>
<UL>
<H3><A NAME="12_16_1">New Features</A></H3>
<LI>Added new &quot;--batch&quot; option to convert HTMLDOC book files from the
 command-line.</LI>
<LI>Added support for the &quot;-display&quot; option on systems that use X11.</LI>
<LI>Now use image objects in PDF output for images when the image width
 * height * depth &gt; 32k.</LI>
<LI>Now use JPEG compression when the number of colors would be &gt; 32
 colors or 16 gray shades.</LI>
<LI>True transparency support for GIF files in PDF 1.3 output!</LI>
<LI>The GUI now automatically changes the extension of the output
 filename as needed.</LI>
<LI>The GUI now collects all error messages and shows them once after
 the document is generated.</LI>
<LI>Added support for HSPACE and VSPACE attributes for images with
 ALIGN=&quot;LEFT&quot; or ALIGN=&quot;RIGHT&quot;.</LI>
<LI>Added new Java interface to HTMLDOC.</LI>
<H3><A NAME="12_16_2">Changes</A></H3>
<LI>Consolidated temporary file management into new file_temp()
 function. The new function also makes use of the Windows &quot;short lived&quot;
 open option which may improve performance with small temporary files.</LI>
<LI>Updated book file format and added an appendix describing the
 format.</LI>
<LI>Now default to PDF 1.3 (Acrobat 4.0) output format.</LI>
<LI>Now output length of PDF streams with the stream object; this offers
 a modest reduction in file size.</LI>
<LI>The HTTP file cache now keeps track of previous URLs that were
 downloaded.</LI>
<LI>The HTTP code now supports redirections (status codes 301 to 303) to
 alternate URLs.</LI>
<LI>Limit the height check for table rows to 1/8th of the page length;
 this seems to provide fairly consistent wrapping of tables without
 leaving huge expanses of blank space at the bottom of pages.</LI>
<LI>The HTML output now also includes a font-family style for PRE text;
 otherwise the body font would override the PRE font with some browsers.</LI>
<LI>The snprintf/vsnprintf emulation functions were not included in the
 HTMLDOC makefile.</LI>
<LI>RGB hex colors are now recognized with or without the leading #.
 This breaks HTML standards compliance but should reduce the number of
 problem reports from buggy HTML.</LI>
<LI>The stylesheet generated with the HTML output no longer contains
 absolute font sizes, just the typefaces and a relative size for
 SUB/SUP.</LI>
<LI>The title image is no longer scaled to 100% in the HTML output.</LI>
<H3><A NAME="12_16_3">Bug Fixes</A></H3>
<LI>The web page output was not divided into chapters for each input
 file.</LI>
<LI>The &quot;make install&quot; target did a clean.</LI>
<LI>The configure script would remove the image libraries if you did not
 have FLTK installed.</LI>
<LI>The fix_filename() function didn't handle relative URLs for images
 (e.g. SRC=&quot;../images/filename.gif&quot;)</LI>
<LI>Comments in the source document were being closed by a &quot;.</LI>
<LI>The command-line and GUI interfaces looked for &quot;outlines&quot; instead of
 &quot;outline&quot; for the page mode.</LI>
<LI>The HTML output code didn't output closing tags for empty elements.</LI>
<LI>The GUI interface started with the compression slider enabled, even
 for HTML output.</LI>
<LI>The beginnings of some lines could start with whitespace.</LI>
<LI>Wasn't aligning images and text on lines based on the line height.</LI>
<LI>The compression slider was enabled in the GUI even though HTML
 output was selected.</LI>
<LI>The Perl example code was incorrect.</LI>
<LI>Fixed the check for whether or not pages were generated.</LI>
<LI>htmlSetCharSet() wasn't reloading the character set data if the data
 directory changed.</LI>
<LI>The GUI did not reset the default background color.</LI>
<LI>The 'C' page number style (chapter page numbers) started at 3
 instead of 1.</LI>
<LI>The chapter links were off by 1 or 2 pages when no title page was
 included.</LI>
